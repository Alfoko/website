                <h2>Swift</h2>
                <p class="skills">At the ripe age of 9 years old, I was interested in making my own games. After hearing about an iPad app that taught you how to code, I set out to learn Swift, a modern programming language developed by Apple. </p>
                <p class="skills">However I soon realized making games was a far more daunting task than I had first imagined. Therefore, I started from scratch, this time with a game engine...</p>
                
                <br>
                <h2>Unity</h2>
                <p class="skills">...I had never used Unity before, but I was intrigued by the possibilities of the game engine. I quickly learned how to use the engine, and I was hooked!</p>
                <p class="skills">A new problem arose though, I didn't know how to code. Thus, I looked up what programming languages were, and which one was best for Unity...</p> 
                    
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h2>C#</h2>
                <p class="skills">...I quickly discovered C#, as well as static and strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming.</p>

                <br><br><br><br><br>
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p class="skills">After a couple of years I had made most of the ideas that crossed my mind into reality, and was curious to see what else was possible with programming. Hence I learnt Python, a language that was advertised as being capable of doing anything. I had fun with Python, however I then grew curious as to how websites were made...</p>

                <br><br><br>
                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p class="skills">...when I first discovered HTML, I found it odd. It was like no other programming languages I had seen before. It used declarative tags instead of imperative lines of code.</p>
                <p class="skills"> I was intrigued by how I could make my websites look good though, and for that reason started to learn...</p>
                
                <br><br><br>
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p class="skills">This was yet again a programming language like no other that I had seen previously. This didn't stop me, I thrived to try and make websites look as good as the ones online. Once again though, I was itching to know what else was possible. Could I implement animations and 3D graphics into my websites?</p>

                <br><br><br><br><br>
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="skills">Turns out I could, with a language fairly similar to C#. I wondered if there was any way to make websites that were more dynamic.</p>

                <br><br><br>
                <h2>PHP</h2>
                <p class="skills">I then found PHP, a language that was touted as being capable of doing anything. I had fun with PHP, however I then grew curious as to if I could modify one of my favorite games, Minecraft...</p>

                <br><br><br>
                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p class="skills">With Java, I was able to do all the things that I wasn't able to do with other languages, and make apps and programs on pretty much any device.</p>

                <br><br><br>
                <h2>Blender</h2>
                <p class="skills">By the time I was 14 I was intrigued by film, special effects, 3D models for my games and more. I had heard about an open-source software called Blender which was notoriously hard to learn, but I decided to try anyway. As it turned out, Blender was a perfect fit. I was able to generate images, animations, edit videos by adding anything from robots to flying pigs and more!</p>

                <br><br><br><br>
                <h2>GIMP</h2>
                <p class="skills">I was interested in learning how to clean up the images I had generated in Blender, so I downloaded an open-source image editor, GIMP, and got to work!</p>

                <br><br><br><br>
                <h2>Godot</h2>
                <p class="skills">I was curious to learn about other game engines, so I started with Godot which used GDScript, a language similar to Python which I was familiar with.</p>

                <br><br><br><br><br>
                <h2>Unreal Engine</h2>
                <p class="skills">"But how are games made so realistic?" I asked myself. I soon learnt that they were made with ray-tracing engines, such as the one used in Unreal Engine.</p>
